    <h2>Design System</h2>
    
    <h3>Color</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">We picked blue as the main color for the FlexiConnect app because it makes people feel calm and peaceful. Blue is known for creating a sense of safety and trust. When businesses use blue in their ads, it shows they care about customers feeling secure. So, by using blue in the FlexiConnect app, we want users to feel calm and confident while using it.</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">We chose to use the Inter font for our app because it is specially designed for screens like ours. This font is very user-friendly, especially when it comes to small text, which is common in job applications. Inter was created by a talented designer named Rasmus Andersson and is free to use, which aligns with our app's focus on being flexible and accessible to everyone.</p>

    <h3>Iconography</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">We chose easy-to-understand icons for our app to make it simple for everyone to use. Each icon shows what it does, like a magnifying glass for searching. This helps people find what they need quickly.</p>
